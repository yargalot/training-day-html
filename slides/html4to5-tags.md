note:
  ####Main
  The HTML main element represents the main content of  the body of a document or application

  ####Nav
  The HTML Navigation Element nav represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.
  (A document may have several nav elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation.)

  ####Aside
  The HTML aside Element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around it, which could be considered separate from that content.
