## API

An API that exposes the components of the document's URL and allows scripts to navigate, redirect and reload (the Location interface).

An API that exposes the session history and allows scripts to update the document's URL without actually navigating, so that applications don't need to abuse the fragment component for "Ajax-style" navigation (the History interface).

An API for base64 conversion (atob() and btoa() methods).

An API to schedule timer-based callbacks (setTimeout() and setInterval()).

An API to prompt the user (alert(), confirm(), prompt(), showModalDialog()).

An API for printing the document (print()).

An API for handling search providers (AddSearchProvider() and IsSearchProviderInstalled()).
