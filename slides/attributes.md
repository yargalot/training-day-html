## Attributes

There are way to many to go through

Important ones:
The data-* collection of Web developer-defined attributes. Web developers can define any attribute they want as long as they prefix it with data- to avoid clashes with future versions of HTML. These are intended to be used to store custom data to be consumed by the Web page or application itself. They are not intended for data to be consumed by other parties (e.g. user agents).
